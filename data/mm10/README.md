# Marker genes for TIME 
## [Myeloid cells](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15147715)
Blood cells.  Granulocytes + monocytes+ erythrocytes + platelets. From
common progenitors (myeloblast) derivated from Hematopoietic stem
cells in the bone marrow. 

## T cells 
### [CD8+ T cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell) 
* Other names: $$T_c$$, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), killer T

#### [Activation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell#Activation) 
1. First signaling: TCR + MHC class I (antigen on APC) 
2. Second signaling: CD28 costimulators + CD80 or CD86 (on APC) 

#### [Effector function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytotoxic_T_cell#Effector%20functions) 
1. Cytotoxins production: perforin, granzymes and granulysin -> apoptosis 
2. FASL(Apo1L, CD95L) expression: FasL -> Fas -> DISC -> cell death 


### [CD4+ T cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell)
* other names: $$T_h$$, T helper cells
* functions: helph other immune cells (Killer T, B, macrophage)  by releasing T cell cytokines 




### [T reg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_T_cell)




## [DCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendritic_cell) 
* Definintion: Antigen presenting cells (accesory cells) for T cells. 
* Function: process antigen and present it. Messengers between innate and adaptive immune systems. 
* Types in vivo - primate : 
  * conventiional (cDC) or Myeloid (mDC): IL-12, IL-6, TNF, chemokines, TLR2,TLR4
    * mDC-1 (more common)
    * mDC-2 (extremely rare) 
  * Plasmacytiod (pDC, interferon-producing cells): look like plasma cells. IFNa, TLR7, TLR9 
    
## [Neutrophil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrophil)
* Definition: most abundant type of granulocytes and white blood cells
(60%-70%). Innate immune system. One of the first-responders of
inflammatory cells
* Function: 
  1. Granulocyte (presenting granules in their cytoplasm), 
  2. Chemotaxis (need receptors), 
  3. Phagocytosis
  4. Neutrophil extracellular traps 
* Subpopulation: neutrophil-killers and neutrophil-cagers 

## [Macrophage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrophage) 

* Definition: a type of white blood cell. Versatile and many roles. 
* Functions: 
  1. Phagocytosis
  2. in Adapative immune system: 
     a. antigen presenting: 
     b. as secretory cell: monokines, carrying receptors, 
* Subtypes:
  1. M1: activated "killer"  macrophage (by LPS, IFNg, TNF, or DAMPs). Secrete high
     levels of IL12 (high)  and low level of IL10
     (low). Pro-inflammatory cytokines (Il6,TNF)  
  2. M2: "repair" function to turn off damaging immune system by
     production anti-inflammatory cytokines like (IL10). Produce high
     IL10, TGFb and low Il12. Help tumor growth.   

* In our case: 
  * TNF and TGFb have promoter acitivity across all major cell types.
